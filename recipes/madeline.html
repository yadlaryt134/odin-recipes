        Ingredients:
    </h2>

    <ul>
        <li>2/3 cup all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon baking powder</li>
        <li>Pinch of salt</li>
        <li>1/2 cup unsalted butter, melted and cooled</li>
        <li>2/3 cup granulated sugar</li>
        <li>2 large eggs</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
        <li>Zest of 1 lemon (optional)</li>
        <li>Powdered sugar, for dusting</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Instructions</h2>

      <ol>
        <li>Preheat your oven to 375°F (190°C). Grease and flour a Madeleine pan to prevent sticking.</li>
        <li>In a small mixing bowl, whisk together the all-purpose flour, baking powder, and salt. Set aside.</li>
        <li>In a separate large mixing bowl, beat the melted butter and granulated sugar until well combined. Add the eggs, one at a time, and beat well after each addition. Stir in the vanilla extract and lemon zest, if desired.</li>
        <li>Gradually add the flour mixture to the wet ingredients and fold gently until just combined. Be careful not to overmix; a few lumps are fine.</li>
        <li>Spoon the batter into the prepared Madeleine pan, filling each mold about three-quarters full.</li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven for about 10-12 minutes or until the edges of the Madeleines are golden brown and the centers spring back when lightly pressed.</li>
        <li>Remove the pan from the oven and let the Madeleines cool in the pan for a few minutes. Then, transfer them to a wire rack to cool completely.</li>
        <li>Once cooled, lightly dust the Madeleines with powdered sugar before serving.</li>
        <li>Enjoy your delicious homemade Madeleines with a cup of tea or coffee!</li>
      </ol>
