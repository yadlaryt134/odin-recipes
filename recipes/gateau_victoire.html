        Ingredients:
    </h2>

    <ul>
        <li>8 ounces (225g) bittersweet chocolate, finely chopped</li>
        <li>1 cup (225g) unsalted butter, cubed</li>
        <li>1 cup (200g) granulated sugar</li>
        <li>6 large eggs</li>
        <li>1/4 cup (30g) all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>Pinch of salt</li>
        <li>Powdered sugar, for dusting</li>
    </ul>

      <h2>Instructions</h2>

      <ol>
        <li>Preheat your oven to 325°F (165°C). Grease a round cake pan and line the bottom with parchment paper.</li>
        <li>In a heatproof bowl set over a saucepan of simmering water, melt the bittersweet chocolate and butter together, stirring occasionally until smooth. Remove from heat and let it cool slightly.</li>
        <li>In a separate mixing bowl, whisk the granulated sugar and eggs together until well combined.</li>
        <li>Slowly pour the melted chocolate mixture into the egg mixture while whisking continuously. Mix until smooth and well incorporated.</li>
        <li>Sift the all-purpose flour and salt into the chocolate batter. Gently fold the dry ingredients into the batter until just combined, ensuring not to overmix.</li>
        <li>Pour the batter into the prepared cake pan, spreading it evenly.</li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven for about 35-40 minutes or until the cake is set and a toothpick inserted into the center comes out with a few moist crumbs.</li>
        <li>Remove the cake from the oven and let it cool in the pan for about 10 minutes. Then, transfer it to a wire rack to cool completely.</li>
        <li>Once cooled, dust the Gateau Victoire with powdered sugar for an elegant finish.</li>
        <li>Serve the cake slices on individual plates and enjoy the indulgent and velvety texture of Gateau Victoire.</li>
      </ol>
